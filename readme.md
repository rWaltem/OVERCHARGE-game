# Ideas for how the game will work

## Movement

### Air control

Players can slightly turn while in the air

### Start boost

Dial spins at start of race with a 'good' area, if player throttles while in the good area, they get a slight boost at start of race

### Specialty track boost

Characters have a specialty track type and they have a speed boost when on their track

### Character - Ship match

If a character and ship both have the same specicalty, their recover time slightly decreases and their rechargeRate slightly increases

### Drifting

While drifting the back of the ship steps out giving them a slightly better turn in

## Controls

- Throttle: A
- Break: B
- Turning: L Stick
- Boost: RB
- R Trick: R Trig
- L Trick: L Trig
- F Trick: Both Trigs
- Item: LB

## Race Types

### Touring

Race 3 or 4 tracks in a cup

### Chaos

Same as touring but with items

### Time Attack

No items or other players, constant RNG

### Online

Online version of touring and chaos

## Track Type

### Mobius

Track does a 180 degree twist so you drive on both sides of the track, aka a mobius strip

### Speed

Track focuses on strights and charge pads to maximize speed

### Inclosed

Track has a tunnel like section where ships can drive on all sides

### End-to-end

Track starts at point A and ends at a different point B

### One-Sided

Track has only one drivable side, aka not a mobius loop

## Ship Stats

- Specialty

## Character Stats

## Hidden stats

## Charge

Ship has charge

Ships have different max charges

Charge Pads recharge ship

If charge is full, charge pads give boost

Charge can be used for temp boost

## 'Tricks'

### Tricks uses some charge for landing boost

### Roll left/right

Slightly rotates and translates ship in direction of roll

### Forward trick (no idea for animations rn)

Gives forward boost in air

## Items

### Bombs

Explodes after a set amount of time and stuns player if hit

### Missile

Shoots in one direction and stuns player if hit

### Heat tracking missile

Same as normal missles but tracks closest player

### Charge pack

Gives player some charge when used

### Resistor bomb

Creates a AOE attack that lowers ships charge when going through

### Frequency Jammer

Makes player invisible to any tracking item

## Camera Effects

### FOV

FOV increases with speed

Final stretch before end of race increases FOV

### Shake

Shake increases with speed
