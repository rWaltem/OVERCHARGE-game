# OVERCHARGE

OVERCHARGE is a fast-paced racing game focused on speed, skill, and careful management of momentum which was inspired by F-Zero GX and Mario Kart. The game features two main modes: one that emphasizes precision driving, track knowledge, and competing against computer-controlled or online opponents; and one that introduces interactive items that affect other players. Races take place on futuristic tracks with non-traditional designs, including enclosed circuits and Möbius-style loops that allow players to drive on both sides of the track in a single lap. Players must manage a charge-based resource, which functions like fuel, gradually depleting over time and more quickly at higher speeds. This resource is used for temporary speed boosts and aerial maneuvers, with successful tricks providing additional speed, encouraging thoughtful risk-taking and efficient movement. Additional mechanics, such as drifting and timing boosts, reward skillful play while keeping control and feedback clear.

## Movement

### Air control

Players can slightly turn while in the air

### Start boost

Dial spins at start of race with a 'good' area, if player throttles while in the good area, they get a slight boost at start of race

### Specialty track boost

Characters have a specialty track type and they have a speed boost when on their track

### Character - Ship match

If a character and ship both have the same specicalty, their recover time slightly decreases and their rechargeRate slightly increases

### Drifting

While drifting the back of the ship steps out giving them a slightly better turn in

## Controls

- Throttle: A
- Break: B
- Turning: L Stick
- Boost: RB
- R Trick: R Trig
- L Trick: L Trig
- F Trick: Both Trigs
- Item: LB

## Race Types

### Touring

Race 3 or 4 tracks in a cup

### Chaos

Same as touring but with items

### Time Attack

No items or other players, constant RNG

### Online

Online version of touring and chaos

## Track Type

### Mobius

Track does a 180 degree twist so you drive on both sides of the track, aka a mobius strip

### Speed

Track focuses on strights and charge pads to maximize speed

### Inclosed

Track has a tunnel like section where ships can drive on all sides

### End-to-end

Track starts at point A and ends at a different point B

### One-Sided

Track has only one drivable side, aka not a mobius loop

## Ship Stats

- Speed
- Accel
- Weight
- Handling

### Hidden Stats

- Max Charge
- Recharge rate
- Recover speed
- Specialty

## Character Stats

- Skill (Recovery Speed)

## Hidden stats

- Specialty

## Charge

Ship has charge

Ships have different max charges

Charge Pads recharge ship

If charge is full, charge pads give boost

Charge can be used for temp boost

## 'Tricks'

### Tricks uses some charge for landing boost

### Roll left/right

Slightly rotates and translates ship in direction of roll

### Forward trick (no idea for animations rn)

Gives forward boost in air

## Items

### Bombs

Explodes after a set amount of time and stuns player if hit

### Missile

Shoots in one direction and stuns player if hit

### Heat tracking missile

Same as normal missles but tracks closest player

### Charge pack

Gives player some charge when used

### Resistor bomb

Creates a AOE attack that lowers ships charge when going through

### Frequency Jammer

Makes player invisible to any tracking item

## Camera Effects

### FOV

FOV increases with speed

Final stretch before end of race increases FOV

### Shake

Shake increases with speed
