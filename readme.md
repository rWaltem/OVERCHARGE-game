# Mechanic ideas

## Movement

- Slight air control
- Charge boost at start
- Characters have a specialty track type and they have a speed boost when on their specialty track
- Drifting corners turns faster

## Race Types

### Touring

Race 3 or 4 tracks in a cup

### Chaos

Same as touring but with items

### Time Attack

No items or other players, constant RNG

### Online

Online version of touring and chaos

## Track Type

### Mobius

Track does a 180 degree twist so you drive on both sides of the track, aka a mobius strip

### Speed

Track focuses on strights and charge pads to maximize speed

### Inclosed

Track has a tunnel like section where ships can drive on all sides

### End-to-end

Track starts at point A and ends at a different point B

### One-Sided

Track has only one drivable side, aka not a mobius loop

## Ship Stats

Speed

Accel

Weight

Handling

### Hidden Stats

## Charge

## 'Tricks'

### Tricks uses some charge for landing boost

### Roll left/right

### Resistor bomb
